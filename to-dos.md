# Problem 1: 
dconf dump file has entries that uses paths looking for "estevao" direcoty in "/home"
## Posible solutions:
	1. Replace current dump file with another dump that only contains entries have been edited by me (entries that differ from default values) and that don't contains paths with my name.
